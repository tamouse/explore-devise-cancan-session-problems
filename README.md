# Explore Rails + Devise + CanCan + ErrorsController + Session

Having some issues on one of my work projects, I need to explore how
these all work together.

The problem is being able to swing back to a path after first being
redirected to sign in.

## Dependencies

* Devise
* CanCan (not CanCanCan)
* PostGreSQL database
